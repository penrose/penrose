## Prerequisites

Be sure you have these tools installed:

- [Git][]
- [Node.js][] v16+ (if using Linux or Mac, we recommend installing via [nvm][])
- [Yarn][] v1.x (you need to install Node.js first)

Depending on your platform, here are some extra instructions:

### Apple Silicon

If you're using an ARM-based Mac, [node-canvas][] (one of our dependencies) also
requires some additional packages to be installed. Install [Homebrew][] if you
don't already have it, then run this command:

```sh
brew install pkg-config cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib librsvg pixman
```

### Windows WSL

Here are some WSL-specific guides:

- [Guide for installing nvm and Node.js][]
- [Guide for installing Yarn][]

## Setup

Once you've installed all prerequisites, [clone][] [this repo][]. Then open a
terminal in your clone of it; for instance, if you cloned it via the terminal,
run this command:

```sh
cd penrose/
```

The rest of this document assumes you are running commands from this directory,
unless otherwise specified. Next [install dependencies][] from [npm][]:

```sh
yarn
```

Finally, enter the directory for our `roger` tool, install it, and then come
back to this directory:

```sh
pushd packages/roger/
yarn install-global
popd
```

## Editor

For [VS Code][] users, we provide a [VS Code workspace][] file called
`penrose.code-workspace` which automatically configures many settings (and
recommends several [extensions][]) that we strongly encourage using. From your
terminal, you can open VS Code to the workspace via this command:

```sh
code penrose.code-workspace
```

You should be automatically prompted to install the extensions we recommend, but
if not, you can now find them listed in the **Extensions** tab.

## Development

### Run

Open a separate terminal (to the same directory), and run these commands:

```sh
cd packages/examples/src/
roger watch
```

You should see this output:

```
watching on port 9160
```

Then, back in your original terminal, run this command:

```sh
yarn start
```

Once it finishes building, you should see this near the end of the output:

```
@penrose/editor:   > Local: http://localhost:3000/try/
@penrose/editor:   > Network: use `--host` to expose
```

Click [that link][]. The page may take some time to load, but once it does, you
should see something like this:

![Roger watch start](docs/assets/roger-startup.png)

Type in the drop-down boxes to search for any Penrose trio in
`packages/examples/src/`; for example:

- Substance: `set-theory-domain/tree.sub`
- Style: `set-theory-domain/venn.sty`
- Domain: `set-theory-domain/setTheory.dsl`

... and voilà! ✨ See the results in your browser:

### Production build

Run this command to build all packages for production:

```sh
yarn build
```

### Typecheck

Run this command to typecheck all packages:

```sh
yarn typecheck
```

### Registry

We have a `packages/examples/src/registry.json` file which lists several
diagrams from the `packages/examples/src/` directory. All the "trios" listed in
this file are automatically run in GitHub Actions to produce the SVG files in
`diagrams/`.

If you create a new diagram in `packages/examples/src/` and you'd like to make
sure that future changes to Penrose don't inadvertently break your diagram, go
ahead add it to the registry! For instance, let's say you create this directory
under `packages/examples/src/`:

```
packages/examples/src/foo-domain/
├── mydomain.dsl
├── bar.sty
└── baz.sub
```

The first step in adding this to the registry is to add the domain under
`"domains"`:

```json
"foo": {
  "name": "My Domain",
  "URI": "foo-domain/mydomain.dsl"
}
```

Next you can add the style under `"styles"` referring to that domain:

```json
"mystyle": {
  "domain": "foo",
  "name": "My Style",
  "URI": "foo-domain/bar.sty"
}
```

And similarly the substance would go under `"substances"`:

```json
"mysubstance": {
  "domain": "foo",
  "name": "My Substance",
  "URI": "foo-domain/baz.sub"
}
```

Then, if you find that these give a nice diagram using variation
`CedarEagle308`, you can add the following under `"trios"`:

```json
{
  "substance": "mysubstance",
  "style": "mystyle",
  "domain": "foo",
  "variation": "CedarEagle308"
}
```

And you're almost done! If you were to commit and push this right now, CI would
fail because it would see that you added a new diagram to the registry without
adding its output SVG file to the `diagrams/` directory. The last thing you need
to do is generate that output and check it into Git.

The easiest way to do this is to run `automator` locally on the registry:

```sh
yarn build --filter=automator
pushd packages/automator/
yarn start batch registry.json ../../diagrams/ --src-prefix=../examples/src/
popd
```

This should regenerate everything in `diagrams/`. Now just commit and push, and
you're on your way!

_**Note:**_ some features relating to text are currently not deterministic
across different operating systems, so diagrams using those features cannot be
included in the registry. See these pull requests for examples of those
limitations:

- [feat: Make Penrose deterministic][]
- [test: Check word cloud example output in CI][]

### Refresh build

To delete all build artifacts (but no `node_modules/`):

```sh
git clean -dfxe node_modules/
```

To delete `node_modules/` (but not build artifacts) in all `packages/`:

```sh
yarn lerna clean
```

To delete the `node_modules/` at the repo root:

```sh
npx rimraf node_modules/
```

To do all of the above at once:

```sh
git clean -dfx
```

### Roger

If `roger` is not working as expected and you think it might be out of date, run
these commands to re-install it:

```sh
pushd packages/roger/
yarn unlink
yarn build
popd
```

### Test

To run all tests:

```sh
yarn test
```

To automatically re-run tests as you make changes to `core`:

```sh
yarn turbo run test-watch
```

### Dependencies

To add a project dependency to, e.g., `browser-ui` (note, we don't use `npm`):

```sh
pushd packages/browser-ui/
yarn add $DEPENDENCY_NAME
popd
```

To add a dev dependency:

```sh
pushd packages/$PACKAGE_NAME/
yarn add --dev $DEPENDENCY_NAME
popd
```

If you're using a package that involves the DOM, you probably want the `react`
version (e.g. `react-graph-vis` instead of `visjs`).

### Scripts

We use [Turborepo][] to manage dependencies among our various scripts/tasks, and
we have a custom `turboConfig.js` script which autogenerates Turborepo's
`turbo.json` config file from metadata in all our `package/*/package.json`
files. Specifically, below the `"scripts"` section we usually have a `"turbo"`
section defining metadata about each script. For instance, given this:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "mkdir dist/ && echo foo > dist/build.txt",
  "test": "cat dist/*.txt"
}
```

we might define the metadata like this:

```json
"turbo": {
  "build": "out: [dist/*.txt]",
  "test": "cache: false, deps: [build]"
}
```

When you update a script, be sure to update its accompanying metadata!

Note that `turboConfig.js` defines a few global scripts which have implicit
dependencies that are automatically inherited by package-local scripts with the
same names:

- `build` means to produce executable artifacts (usually JavaScript files), and
  implicitly depends on the `build` scripts of that package's dependencies
- `build-decls` means to produce TypeScript declaration files, and implicitly
  depends on the `build-decls` scripts of that package's dependencies
- `typecheck` means to check for type errors in the package, and implicitly
  depends on the `build-decls` script of that same package (with the intention
  being that for any given package you either write a `build-decls` script or a
  `typecheck` script, but not both)

The `"turbo"` metadata is written in [YAML][] syntax, where the following keys
are allowed:

- `deps` corresponds to Turborepo's `dependsOn` key, except that it also
  inherits the `dependsOn` from the existing global definition of the script if
  there is one (see above)
- `out` corresponds to Turborepo's `outputs` key, except that it defaults to the
  empty array `[]` instead of to `["dist/**", "build/**"]`
- `cache` corresponds to Turborepo's `cache` key

See the [Turborepo docs][] for more information.

### Import from core

To import a type or function from `core` in another package like `browser-ui`,
import the type into `packages/core/src/index.ts` and export it from there
again, then import into your project.

## Contributing

### Creating your fork

If you'd like to make a change and contribute it back to the project, but you
don't have write permissions to this repository, you'll need to [create a
fork][]. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of this page.

You should already have a clone of this repo by following the instructions at
the start of this document, so now you simply need to add your fork as another
[remote][]:

```sh
git remote add fork https://github.com/<your-github-account-name>/penrose.git
```

### Finding an issue to work on

Check out our list of [good first issues][].

- Before working on one of them, let us know that you are interested so we can
  give you more guidance! (Currently the issue descriptions are fairly brief.)

- Create a separate [branch][] in your forked repo to work on the issue:

  ```sh
  git switch --create my-branch
  git push --set-upstream fork my-branch
  ```

### Merging new changes from upstream

If you need to merge new changes from upstream (i.e. the original Penrose repo):

```sh
git fetch origin main:main
git merge main
```

After running the above, manage any [merge conflicts][], [commit][] to your
branch, and then [push][] to your fork:

```sh
git push
```

### Opening a pull request (PR)

When your work is ready for review:

- [Open a pull request][] (PR) by clicking on the **Contribute** button on the
  homepage of your forked repo
  (`https://github.com/<your-github-account-name>/penrose`).
- Put `fix:` or `feat:` at the beginning of the PR title depending on if it's a
  fix or a feature. We follow [conventional commit guidelines][] in our repo.
- Document your changes in the PR's description (including _specific paths for
  reproducing specific examples_, and link(s) to any issue(s) you address).
- Some things will be checked automatically by our [CI][]:
  - Make sure the system passes the regression tests.
  - Run [Prettier][] via `yarn format`.
- If you have permission, request review from the relevant person. Otherwise, no
  worries: we'll take a look at your PR and assign it to a maintainer.
- When your PR is approved, a maintainer will merge it.

If you hit any snags in the process, run into bugs, or just have questions,
please file an issue!
