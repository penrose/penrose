# Penrose [![Build](https://github.com/penrose/penrose/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/penrose/penrose/actions/workflows/build.yml)

**Penrose is an early-stage system that is still in development.** Our system is not ready for contributions or public use yet, but hopefully will be soon. Send us an email if you're interested in collaborating.

- See [the site](http://www.penrose.ink/) for more information and examples.
- See the [wiki](https://github.com/penrose/penrose/wiki) for more system-specific information on building, running, testing, and debugging the system.
- For even more documentation, see Nimo Ni's [README](https://github.com/wodeni/notes-public/blob/master/penrose/archive/ramp-down.md).

### Example

Here's a simple Penrose visualization in the domain of set theory.

It's specified by the following Substance and Style programs.

- `tree.sub`
  ```
  Set A
  Set B
  Set C
  Set D
  Set E
  Set F
  Set G
  Subset B A
  Subset C A
  Subset D B
  Subset E B
  Subset F C
  Subset G C
  NoIntersect E D
  NoIntersect F G
  NoIntersect B C
  ```
- `venn.sty`

  ```
  Set x {
      shape = Circle { }
      constraint contains(x, x.label)
  }

  Intersect x y {
      constraint overlapping(x, y)
      constraint disjoint(y.label, x)
      constraint disjoint(x.label, y)
  }

  NoIntersect x y {
      constraint nonOverlapping(x, y)
  }

  Subset x y {
      constraint contains(y, x)
      constraint smallerThan(x, y)
      constraint disjoint(y.label, x)
  }

  NoSubset x y {
      objective repel(x, y)
      constraint disjoint(x, y)
      constraint disjoint(y.label, x)
      constraint disjoint(x.label, y)
      constraint nonOverlapping(x, y)
  }
  ```

Here's how the optimization looks live in the UI.
