# Group theory

This example is stub for visualizations of groups from abstract algebra. A group is specified in a Substance file via its multiplication table, and perhaps other metadata (like its generators). See `Group.dsl` for basic type definitions. Currently there is just one Style available, `CayleyGraph.sty` which draws a group as a Cayley graph. However, it would be easy to build other styles, e.g., that explicitly visualize the multiplication table, or provide other kinds of visualization.

A Mathematica notebook `GroupToSubstance.nb` is provided that can synthesize an input Substance program from Mathematica's large library of groups.
