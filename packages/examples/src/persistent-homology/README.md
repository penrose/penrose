# persistent-homology

In topological data analysis, persistent homology is used for understanding topological properties like holes in point cloud datasets. In this example, the dataset `X` is a set of points in plane. The diagram illustrates the construction of a simplicial complexes (sets of connections between the points rendered as lines) based on increasing radius `epsilon` around the dots. For a given value of the `epsilon`, two points are connected by line if their respective balls overlap.
