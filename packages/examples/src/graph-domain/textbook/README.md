# Graph theory textbook diagrams

These diagrams are inspired by Chapter 10 of the 7th edition of _Discrete
Mathematics and Its Applications_, by Kenneth H. Rosen. We use the following
naming conventions:

- `secXfigY.substance` means Figure _Y_ from Section 10._X_
- `secXexY.substance` means Exercise _Y_ from Section 10._X_
