Usage: python makeSubstance [-i] [-o]
-i specifies the input file; if left blank "input.txt" is used.
-o specifies the output Substance file; if left blank "array.substance" is used.


Write values separated by commas to create an array of those values.
Multiple arrays can be created by writing lists on multiple lines.

eg,

1,2,3,4,5
55,76,99,32

will create two arrays.

If the first entry in a line is enclosed in quotes (" or ') or $ signs, it will
be used as the array label; otherwise, labels will be automatically generated.

If an entry has a * character in it, that element will appear highlighted in red
in the final diagram using the highlight() predicate.

Entries with a ^ character will have a dotted rectangle drawn around them such
that all are encompassed by it using the Group() type and inGroup() predicate.
Entries different rows will use different groups,but note that the substance
format allows any combination of elements to share a group;
the script does it this way for simplicity only.
