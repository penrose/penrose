# `@penrose/components`: a React component library for Penrose

`@penrose/components` includes a collection of React components for building Penrose clients (e.g. `@penrose/panels` and `@penrose/browser-ui`).

## Getting started

For a minimal example, try using the `Simple` component in your React application:

```ts
import { Simple } from `@penrose/components`;

const domain = `
type Set
`;

const substance = `
Set A
AutoLabel All
`;

const style = `
canvas {
  width = 500
  height = 500
}
Set X {
  X.shape = Circle { }
  X.text  = Text { string: X.label }
  ensure contains(X.shape, X.text)
  ensure maxSize(X.shape, canvas.width / 2)
}
`;

const App = () => (
  <Embed
    domainString={domain}
    substanceString={substance}
    styleString={style}
  />
);

export default App;
```

## Building and Running

- Run `yarn build` to build the library
- In your client library, make sure you have `react` and `react-dom` as dependencies. `@penrose/components` has both packages as peer dependencies and does not bundle them.
- Run `yarn storybook` to preview the components with some examples.
