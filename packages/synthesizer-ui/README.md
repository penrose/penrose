# Synthesizer UI Package

The general purpose of this web-app is to provide a user-interface which problem authors or Penrose users can interact with to generate multiple diagrams, view mutated programs, and export diagrams that they like. This is a first pass, so it covers some core functionalities with opportunities to extend as necessary. The core things that it does:

- Runs the synthesizer to generate multiple mutated programs based on a file triple
- Provides a default substance, domain, and style program but they can be altered if the author chooses
- Provides settings that can be adjusted to configure how many programs, mutations/program, and types of statements can be mutated on
- Each mutated program displays its CIEE as well as the operations and mutated substance program
- Clicking on a checkbox stages it for exporting, and clicking on the EXPORT button downloads all staged diagrams as SVGs
