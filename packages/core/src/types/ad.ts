// The following two regions define the core types for our symbolic
// differentiation engine.
//
// - The "implicit" representation is used essentially as a DSL to construct
//   computation graphs, via the convenience functions provided in
//   engine/AutodiffFunctions. It does not include any information about
//   derivatives, because those can can be constructed symbolically from the
//   implicit representation. NaÃ¯vely serializing the implicit representation
//   would produce a tree structure with a lot of redundancy, because some nodes
//   that can be reached by following different paths are actually identical.
//
// - The "explicit" representation is an intermediate structure used to
//   represent a computation graph, with derivatives included alongside
//   everything else. The number of nodes and edges are unambiguously stored,
//   and each node has a unique ID so structural sharing is not represented
//   purely by object identity. The main value of this representation is that we
//   can call an off-the-shelf topological sort function on it, which is useful
//   both while constructing the derivatives within it and also while compiling
//   it to the final representation.
//
// We only need to compute the gradient of the energy, but we also need to to
// compute other values that may not even be intermediate computations for the
// energy. Thus, the explicit representation (but not the implicit
// representation) distinguishes the "primary" output (for which the gradient is
// computed) from "secondary" outputs (for which no derivatives are computed).
