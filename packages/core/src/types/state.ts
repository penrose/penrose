// Some compDict functions (currently only sampleColor) need a prng, so we need
// to keep a seed around in the state to allow us to recreate it at every step
// in order for those functions to give deterministic results as the
// optimization progresses. However, our code is currently not very
// well-structured, so there are a lot of different places that independently
// evaluate expressions which can include calls to these nondeterministic
// compDict functions. Thus, as a temporary solution, we keep around a different
// seed for each of those places (only the ones in index.ts), so that even
// though they won't be able to agree with each other, at least each one will
// agree with itself across different steps of the optimization. Note, to be
// clear: the fact that the different places using different seeds disagree with
// each other is actually a problem, but for now that problem doesn't have a
// negative impact because we don't currently use color in the optimization
// itself. An ideal solution would be to not keep around any prng or seed in the
// state at all, and instead generate an explicit representation of all
// necessary randomness during an initial sampling that happens right after
// compilation.
