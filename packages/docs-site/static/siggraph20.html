      <h2>Abstract</h2>

      <p>
        We introduce a system called <i>Penrose</i> for creating mathematical
        diagrams. Its basic functionality is to translate abstract statements
        written in familiar math-like notation into one or more possible visual
        representations. Rather than rely on a fixed library of visualization
        tools, the visual representation is user-defined in a constraint-based
        specification language; diagrams are then generated automatically via
        constrained numerical optimization. The system is user-extensible to
        many domains of mathematics, and is fast enough for iterative design
        exploration. In contrast to tools that specify diagrams via direct
        manipulation or low-level graphics programming, <i>Penrose</i> enables
        rapid creation and exploration of diagrams that faithfully preserve the
        underlying mathematical meaning. We demonstrate the effectiveness and
        generality of the system by showing how it can be used to illustrate a
        diverse set of concepts from mathematics and computer graphics.
      </p>

      <h2>Want to use <i>Penrose</i> or collaborate?</h2>

      <p>
        Please note that <i>Penrose</i> is an early-stage system that is still
        in development. Our system is not ready for contributions or public use
        yet, but we're working on it!

            <i>Fig. 1.</i> <i>Penrose</i> is a framework for specifying how
            mathematical statements should be interpreted as visual diagrams. A
            clean separation between abstract mathematical objects and their
            visual representation provides new capabilities beyond existing
            code- or GUI-based tools. Here, for instance, the same set of
            statements is given three different visual interpretations, via
            Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic geometry. (Further samples are

            <i>Fig. 4.</i> By specifying diagrams in terms of abstract
            relationships rather than explicit graphical directives, they are
            easily adapted to a wide variety of use cases. Here we use identical
            <i>Penrose</i> code to generate ray tracing diagrams for several
            targets (Sec 5.6). Though the arrangement and number of objects
            changes in each example, the meaning remains the same.

            jointly optimize visual attributes that are difficult to coordinate
            by hand. Here for instance we optimize color contrast according to
            the spatial proximity of adjacent disks <i>(left to right)</i>,
            ultimately discovering a two-color solution <i>(far right)</i>. The
            system can also be used to debug the optimization process itself—in
            this case by drawing the hue of each disk as a dot on a color wheel.

            <i>Fig. 22.</i> Once a complex diagram has been built, it can be
            easily broken into pieces or stages by, <i>e.g.</i>, commenting out
            lines of <i>Substance</i> code. Here we illustrate steps in Euclid's
            proof of the Pythagorean theorem, turning Byrne's static figure
            <i>(far right)</i> into a progressive "comic strip."

            <i>Fig. 24.</i> A language-based specification makes it easy to
            visually inspect data structures or assemble progressive diagrams
            with only minor changes to program code. Here we draw the simplicial
            <i>link</i> by building it up from simpler constituent operations.

            <i>Fig. 29.</i> Though the energy in the objective function can help
            guide a sampling strategy, choosing which diagram looks "best" to a
            given user is necessarily a subjective decision. The ability to
            automatically generate many alternatives makes it easier to find a
            satisfactory diagram. Here we show a gallery of
            automatically-generated variants of <i>Fig. 1.</i>
