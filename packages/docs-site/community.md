# Get Involved

We are actively building a community of diagrammers! To get started, join the Penrose community now on [discord][] and see [what you can do](#what-you-can-do) to achieve the vision of democratizing diagramming and visual intuition.

## What you can do

<div class="action-grid">

<div class="action-group diagrams">

<h1 class="action-header">ðŸŒ¹ Make Diagrams</h1>

We are always excited to see diagrams made with Penrose! Share them in [#gallery][] on [Discord][] and we are happy to include them in our [example gallery][].

- **If you want to make diagrams using in existing domains**, check out our [tutorial][] and [gallery][example gallery] to learn how to use them!
- **If you are making many diagrams in a new domain**, refer to our [docs][using penrose] to learn our toolings and [open a PR][contributing PR] in our repo so others can use your domain too!

</div>

<div class="action-group research">

<h1 class="action-header">ðŸ”­ Do Research</h1>

Our [team][] consists of interdisciplinary researchers in programming languages, computer graphics, human-computer interaction, software engineering, and more!

- If you are interested in **collaborating with us on research**, reach out to us on [Discord][] and/or [email][] us with a brief description of your background and interests in Penrose!
- If you are **an undergrad looking for summer opportunities**, consider applying for the [REUSE][] program.

</div>

<div class="action-group code-docs">

<h1 class="action-header">ðŸ’» Contribute Code and Docs</h1>

We welcome contributions to our [repository][]. Take a look at the [contributor guide](https://github.com/penrose/penrose/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started!

- Find out what's on the [roadmap][] for our next release. **We are looking for contributors to claim issues in the [planned](#ðŸŽ¯-planned) list**.
- **Help us improve our docs!** We are planning to improve our [tutorial][] and start documenting our [gallery][example gallery] diagrams.

</div>

<div class="action-group integration">

<h1 class="action-header">ðŸ’ž Integrate with Tools</h1>

We'd love to hear how you'd like to integrate Penrose with your favorite tools! Here are some ongoing tool integration projects:

- [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/): [ProofWidgets](https://github.com/EdAyers/ProofWidgets4) based on Penrose.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/): an experimental [`obsidian-penrose-plugin`][].
- [Alloy](http://alloytools.org/) visualizer using Penrose.

Join [our Discord server][discord] and chat with us on [#integration](https://discord.com/channels/1115349463603617954/1130497270664679444) about integrating with external tools!

</div>

<div class="action-group posts">

<h1 class="action-header">ðŸ’¬ Share Knowledge</h1>

We maintain a [blog][] and a [mailing list][] on Penrose and diagramming in general. We are happy to host your posts!
