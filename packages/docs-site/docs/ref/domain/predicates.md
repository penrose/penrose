# Predicate Declarations

A _predicate_ represents mathematical or logical statements regarding zero or more objects or other statements. To declare a predicate, we write

```domain
predicate predicate_name (argument_list)
```

where

- `predicate_name` is the name of the predicate, which can be referred to in the Substance and [Style] schemas; and
- `argument_list` describes the types of objects that this predicate works with. We will go more into its details below.

The arguments in `argument_list` contains the types of objects that this predicate accepts, separated by commas. Here is a Domain schema that contains a couple of type declarations and four different, valid, predicate declarations:

```domain
type FirstType, SecondType

predicate P1 (FirstType, SecondType)
predicate P2 (SecondType a1, SecondType a2)
predicate P3 ()
predicate P4 (FirstType, SecondType, SecondType)
```

Notice how some declarations have names associated with the argument types (e.g. `P2` with argument names `a1` and `a2`), and some don't. These names to argument types are allowed and encouraged to enhance readability, but are not required.

## Symmetric Predicates

Some relations between objects are symmetric: for example, in the set-theory domain, the relations "_a_ intersects _b_" and "_b_ intersects _a_" are equivalent. As a recent new feature, Penrose supports symmetric predicates:

```domain
symmetric predicate predicate_name (argument_type, argument_type)
```

For now, Penrose only supports symmetry of binary predicates (taking exactly two arguments), and, the two arguments must be of the exact same type in the Domain schema (not necessarily when the predicate is used in the Substance and [Style] schemas).

As an example, consider the following valid Domain schema in the chemistry domain:

```domain
type Atom
type Hydrogen <: Atom
type Oxygen <: Atom
symmetric predicate Bond (Atom, Atom)
```

The predicate `Bond` is declared symmetric. Then, if `H` is a `Hydrogen` and `O` is an `Oxygen`, then `Bond(H, O)` and `Bond(O, H)` are considered equivalent by the Penrose engine. In other words, if Penrose expects to see `Bond(H, O)` in the Substance or [Style] schemas, then it will also accept `Bond(O, H)` even though the order of arguments are different.
