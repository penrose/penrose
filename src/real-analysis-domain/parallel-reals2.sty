/* Problem: there are multiple copies of R here, they are just superimposed

I feel like we need some kind of global Substance analysis phase. Can we analyze the Sub prog and generate a Style?
if we could analyze the prog, what would we do?
is it too much to expect a "local" Style program to be able to deal with this R behavior in all situations?
should we give up on the dream of a generic Style? I could easily analyze the Sub program myself (as a Style-writer) and write a Style for that Sub program
or make Style more expressive on first match, on second match or some reflection on the translation "if this shape/attribute already exists, use it and don't draw it"
or a lot of really specific selectors: if both functions are from I,J to R, and are not composed then delete the second shape. hard to know how these interact/cascade

Proposed solution: 
if there's any real or interval, draw an R
if there's any function from reals /  interval in R to reals / interval in R, draw another R
if there's any function composed w/ another, draw another R (and so on). 
(write selectors for the composition of up to 4 functions)
(i think this is OK for most use cases)
what if there are "parallel composed functions"?
don't these R copies need to be programmatically named?
can't just call them R1, R2, R3, and they can't be local sels, and they can't be attached to the function */
